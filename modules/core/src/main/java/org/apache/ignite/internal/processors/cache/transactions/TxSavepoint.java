/**
 * A savepoint is a special mark inside a transaction that allows all commands
 * that are executed after it was established to be rolled back,
 * restoring the transaction state to what it was at the time of the savepoint.
 *
 * <h1 class="header">Usage</h1>
 *
 * The execution result guarantee that only values 1 and 3 are inserted into cache:
 *
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * Ignite ignite = ....;
 * IgniteCache<Integer, Integer> c = ....;
 *
 * try (Transaction tx = ignite.transactions().txStart()) {
 *     c.put(1, 1);
 *
 *     tx.savepoint("mysavepoint");
 *
 *     c.put(2, 2);
 *
 *     tx.rollbackToSavepoint("mysavepoint");
 *
 *     c.put(3, 3);
 *
 *     tx.commit();
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * The result of this transaction is:
 * <p>
 * cache.get(1) - 1,
 * <br>
 * cache.get(2) - null,
 * <br>
 * cache.get(3) - null.
 * </p>
 * <h1 class="header">Restrictions</h1>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>Savepoints works only with {@code TRANSACTIONAL} caches on the node where transaction started.</li>
 * <li>In case of {@code ATOMIC} caches and caches from other nodes - they will be ignored.
 * There is no need in savepoints because every action commits immediately.</li>
 * </ul>
